Always use git status to find out if all chamges are commited. 
There is super usefull command called :
 git checkout    -which resrtore a previous version of code and rewrite it. 
To see difference and return to previous state of code (before any changas been made) use:
git diff chapter3.txt       (specify file name you want to see difference in).
